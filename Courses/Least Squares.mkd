# Least Squares

## Description

The course "Least Squares" focuses on the least squares method, a mathematical approach used for fitting a mathematical model to observed data. This technique is widely used in regression analysis, curve fitting, and solving overdetermined systems. The course covers both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of the least squares method.
